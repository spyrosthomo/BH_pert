#-------- not essential 
1.  [X] Interaction: BICs used 
2.  [ ] Improve the Initial contion for the deribative 
3.  [X] Interaction: pot used
4.  [X] module for 2d plots
5.  [X] Interaction: method used
6.  [ ] General Modification: -arguments->essential/defining parameters for the function
                             -everything else from inc.py file 
7.  [X] DELETE observer choice from main and put it to the fitting file
8.  [ ]  check if files for t and xt save already exist and don't save again the same
9.  [ ] increase the number of classes as much as possible
10. [ ] dont save data in a hughe array and then to file. save dierectly to file an kai den tha exei megalh epiptwsh ston xrono 
#-------- physics 
- [X] PS pot
- [X] GR pot without tort
- [X] GR pot with tortoise
- [X] non-reflecting boundary conditions 
- [X] fitting to get QNMs
- [ ] fft to get the frequencies of an evolution of an amplitude
- [ ] Make LeapFrog higher order (e.g w/ Lax-Wendroff)
- [ ] Fix LeapFrogMat since it's faster
- [ ] Lax method for NR BCs to kill amplitude instabilities
- [X] CONVERGENCE TEST !!! 
- [ ] VARY observer position
- [X] fix NR BCs @ second order
- [ ] add IC: \partial_t\psi(0,x) = \partial_x\psi(0,x)
- [ ] consider waveforms with different A, sigma
- [ ] qnm for pt potential
